# Stream in Node.js: Efficient Data Processing and Real-time Streaming

This repository contains the code and resources for the video tutorial on stream processing and real-time streaming in Node.js.

In this video tutorial, we explore the powerful "Stream" module in Node.js, which revolutionizes data processing and real-time streaming capabilities. Streams allow for efficient handling of data in a streaming fashion, where data is processed in small, manageable chunks rather than loading everything into memory at once.

## Video Overview

- Introduction to streams in Node.js
- Understanding the different types of streams: Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform
- Workflow of streams: data flow and piping
- Backpressure handling for efficient data flow
- Leveraging streams for processing large datasets and real-time streaming
- Benefits of using streams for memory efficiency and scalability

## Getting Started

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ahmedemad3/video-stream.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd video-stream`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the sample application: `npm start`

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system before running the code.
